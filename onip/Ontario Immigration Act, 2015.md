Preamble

The Government of Ontario recognizes the long history of immigration to Ontario and the important nation-building role it has played, and continues to play, in forming Ontario’s social, economic and cultural values. The Government of Ontario is committed to implementing a vision of immigration to the province that recognizes not only the important role that immigrants play in growing the economy across Ontario but also the importance of family and humanitarian commitments. Ontario is a province that celebrates the benefits of being the new home of people from many cultures and from around the world. Thus, Ontario’s vision is also based on inclusivity and respect for cultural diversity.

To implement its vision for immigration, the Government of Ontario is committed to the following goals:

1.  Collaborating with the Government of Canada on the recruitment, selection and admission, to Ontario, of immigrants and foreign nationals on a temporary basis.

2.  Collaborating with all partners, including municipalities and employers, to address the short-term and long-term labour market needs of Ontario.

3.  Collaborating with all partners, including the not-for-profit sector, to enable immigrants to settle in Ontario and to integrate quickly into and to participate fully in Ontario society.

4.  Enabling all communities across Ontario, including Franco-Ontarian communities, to attract, welcome and integrate immigrants.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:
